# Quarrel Archival Project

This is a fan-made archival of Quarrel, a word game by Denki Games that was shut down by Disney. The game was released for iOS in 2011, and for Xbox Live Arcade in 2012.

This project serves as an unofficial "rulebook" for Quarrel. It does not violate any copyright laws. We merely aim to make it easier for people to understand the rules of the game.
